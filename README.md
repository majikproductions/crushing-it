Crushing It is a tracking app that eschews distraction. You pick a thing you want to do, a target, and how many you’ve already done (if any). As you do the thing, you can tap dots to mark more as complete (or just edit the goal, if you don’t like tapping). The app tracks your progress and shows you in percent and with the color of the goal.

When you finish, you can restart the goal.
